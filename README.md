### What is VisuRank?
VisuRank is a simple PHP-based website, that provides customisability and visual flair to basic ranked lists.  

It is currently an early work-in-progress project. The complete version will allow you to create, edit, store, and view lists, and play fun games based off their contents. 

The long-term goal is to migrate the finished website (essentially a WAMP stack, once the database is implemented) to the Google Cloud platform.
